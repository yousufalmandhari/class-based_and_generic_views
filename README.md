Understand class-based and generic views
Create class-based views to handle HTTP requests and send HTTP responses

Concepts covered in the lab
1) Class-based views (CBVs): In Django, class-based views refer to a method of defining views using classes instead of functions. CBVs provide a more structured and reusable approach to handling HTTP requests and generating responses.
2) Generic views: Generic views in Django are a type of class-based view that offers pre-defined, reusable views for common use cases. They aim to reduce repetitive code and simplify common web development patterns.
3) Function-based views (FBVs): In Django, function-based views are a way of defining views using regular Python functions. They are the simplest and most basic approach for handling HTTP requests and generating responses in Django.
